# Covid-19WebApp
I have created my first C# Core Web Application using ASP.NET in Visual Studio. 
The web app is a Covid-19 online medical help service, which patients can to keep up to date with information relating to Covid-19 and book online appointments.
However, the website as of yet is just a foundation and some functionalities are yet to work, such as:
- When a user creates an account it is not yet linked to the My SQL database (at this time i have entered a user login and password to the database myself).
Also, i have been playing around with creating new items for my website, such as:
- A blog post has been created in the 'views' and then 'shared' folder. Which, i have placed it in the 'layout' page for now. 
- This is temporary while i have just been playing around creating items and i am yet to implement it to its own page.
- ALso, i have created its own design using bootstrap and css. However, i am unable to get it working as of yet.
Overall, the webiste is far from complete and this is just a demonstration of some of my work.
